        With an MSc in Chemistry from McGill, I bring strong analytical skills
        and a passion for problem-solving. I transitioned into software
        engineering, where I build full-stack apps with React, Next.js, and
        MongoDB. My goal is to join a fast-paced development team where I can
        contribute and grow.
